## About the Datasets

Due to the large size of the dataset, we provide a download link for the dataset here:

## Preprocessing

We use Joern to generate the code structure graph and we provide a compiled version of joern [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZktZFTbSR0NoPyFRuJDXmDsJYChoVwhF?usp=share_link). It should be noted that the graphs generated by different versions of Joern may have significant differences. So if using the newer versions of Joern to generate code structure graph, the model may have a different performance compared with the results we reported in the paper.

## Environment

Ubuntu 20.04

## Figure

We put the figures in `figs\` folder
